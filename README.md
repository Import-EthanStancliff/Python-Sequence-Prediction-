# Python-Sequence-Prediction-
Basically, this is just to predict sequences
Anyone is welcome to create their own method.
However, it has to be pure Python (preferably 3).
Also, ask before modifying somebody else's file.
This is my first repo that contains actual programs, so if I'm doing something wrong, feel free to tell me!


Finished:

Todo:
